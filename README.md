# angular-movies
Sample app on AngularJS and OMDb API integration.

OMDb is the open movies database which is used as a backend for this app.

We also demonstrate how to create forms, tables, validation and the use of ng-routes.

This is a very simple demo just for presentation purposes.

## Installation
To Install:

    npm Install

To run in development mode:

    npm start

To build for production:

    npm run build

To test the production build:

    npm run server

## Techonologies

This app exists to proof-concept newer Web technologies. 
It is very simple, yet it is always changing when it comes to technologies.

These are the technologies demonstrated at this time:

### ES6/ES2015/ES2017

ECMAScript 6 (now called ECMAScript 2015, 2017 is coming soon) is the current standard for JavaScript, but only a few features are supported in some browsers at present.
For these reason we developers must either stay in a hostile past of ES5 or use tooling that allows us to live in the suggar world of modern JS and transpiles our code to ES5 compatible with all web browsers.

We are using  [babel](https://babeljs.io/]) to compile ES6 into JavaScript.

### Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is a module bundler, a program that allows developers to better handle coode modules and their dependencies as well as bundle static assets into their code, distributing optimized code to their customers.
Webpack can also be used to implement development workflows, although Webpack is not a task runner itself.
